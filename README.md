I listed below the features of this python tkinter gui project.

   In order to get information about the system configuration, I use the platform and psutil python libraries.

   Additionally, you will see a continuous percentage change as you charge.

4. This GUI project contains 10 applications.

5. Weather App  - You may view the weather reports for any city or location worldwide by clicking the weather icon.  
                  To obtain weather information, I use the Open Weather Map API.
